<h2>Data gathered through Mediasmart Console</h2>
<p>mediasmart is the programmatic media buying platform that mediasmart uses to serve mobile advertising campaigns in its network of supply partners. mediasmart does not gather personal data of users who see mediasmart ads. On the contrary, it only gathers non personal information that can be used to univocally identify a user, for example, IP address, mobile carrier, connection type (WiFi vs 3G), advertising ID (IDFA and GAID) or operating system.</p>
<p>The information gathered is used to serve more relevant advertising, making advertising more effective and helping many applications and websites to monitize, so that they can offer free content and services. In some cases, we can also use the obtained information to combine it with non personal information from third parties and improve mediasmart´s capabiities. For example, thanks to the IO and a third party database, we can infer the región a user is seeing an ad in.</p>
<p>Aggregated information, never individual, can be shared with our clients and our suppliers for business purposes, such as reporting, invoicing, etc… mediasmart shall also share user data if so required by law. Or to share with a related entity as a result of a corporate transaction, such as a merger, an acquisition, total or parcial asset sale, bankrupcy, etc…</p>
<p>mediasmart uses cookies and other similar storage methods to identify users and offer them interest-based advertising. In compliance with article 22 of the LSSI, mediasmart´s supply partners shall get agreement from their publishers to inform their users that, in case they accept in the corresponding checkbox, those storage devices will be used. At mediasmart we commit to respecting the user selection and we do not use any storage device that can ignore the privacy options defined by the user in her device.</p>

How to Opt Out of Interest-based Advertising</p>
<p>Your iOS or Android mobile device may provide a “Limit Ad Tracking” or “Opt out of interest-based advertising” setting. When you have opted out using this setting on a device, Mediasmart will not use information collected from that device to infer your interests or serve ads to that device that are targeted based on your inferred interests. Mediasmart requires its advertising customers to honor opt-out preferences expressed using these controls.</p>
<p>You can find the setting for your mobile device by following the directions below.
 iOS Device
iOS 7 or Higher
Go to your Settings &gt; Select Privacy &gt; Select Advertising &gt; Enable the “Limit Ad Tracking” setting
iOS 6
Go to your Settings &gt;Select General &gt; Select About &gt; Select Advertising &gt; Enable the “Limit Ads Tracking” setting
More information about the iOS setting can be found here.
Android Device</p>
<p>For Android devices with OS 2.2 and up and Google Play Services version 4.0 and up:
Open your Google Settings app &gt; Ads &gt; Enable “Opt out of interest-based advertising”
If you’ve turned on Limit Ad Tracking on your iOS device or the Opt out of interest-based ads on your Android device, you can restore interest-based ads by turning the settings off.</p>
<p>When you opt out, you may still see the same number of ads from Mediasmart on your mobile device; however, these ads may be less relevant because they won’t be based on your interests.  Mediasmart may continue to serve you ads based on other non-personal information, such as ads related to the content of the application you are using.</p>
