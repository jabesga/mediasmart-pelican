    <p>mediasmart has partnered with TVTY, the moment marketing platform that allows brands to instantly connect online advertising to what’s going on in the offline world. By combining TVTY video fingerprint technology and mediasmart´s mediasmart demand side platform, the partnership allows brands to reach people at the key moments when they reach for their smartphone or tablet to check the web or interact on social media. Ultimately, it will maximize advertising effectiveness and help advertisers achieve stronger results.</p>
<p>TVTY monitors every TV ad, in real-time, across over 400 TV channels in 25 countries, using a combination of automated ‘video finger printing’ and human analysis. This allows brands to see exactly which ad is being aired, not an approximation based on a media plan model. Once a designated ad is detected, the TVTY platform triggers a mobile campaign configured on mediasmart. This enables advertisers to boost campaigns in real time at the right moment and across multiple platforms. TVTY can also trigger campaigns based on offline information, such as weather conditions, financial information or live sporting events.</p>
<p>“We are very excited to partner with TVTY and incorporate its innovative technology, to enhance our ongoing effort to help advertisers reach their mobile audiences effectively. With the ubiquity of mobile devices and TVTYs technology, our advertisers can now move a step closer to the goal of creating impact with their target users at exactly the right moment in time”, says Noelia Amoedo, mediasmart CEO.</p>
<p>Pierre Marechal, Co-founder of TVTY, said: “With consumers bombarded by so much advertising each day and the rising cost of online advertising, it’s more important than ever for brands to be in the moment when it comes to their marketing message. Our partnership with Mediasmart’s mediasmart demand side platform will allow brands to cut through the noise, be relevant and optimise their mobile media spend.”</p>
<h3>ABOUT TVTY</h3>
<p>TVTY enables advertisers to synchronize their digital campaigns with offline events in real time (TV shows, commercials, weather/weather forecasts, sporting events, financial triggers, and more).

<p>With TVTY&#8217;s SaaS Moment Marketing Platform, advertisers pick offline moments, and sync their existing digital campaigns seamlessly.
