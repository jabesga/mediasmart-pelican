			<h1>Mobile advertising company Mediasmart Mobile expands to UK</h1>
			<p>Mediasmart Mobile, a leading mobile RTB platform, today announced the opening of a new London office. Launched in 2012, mediasmart aims to build on their current success as one of the first movers in the European and Latin American markets. The British office will serve London based companies for local, European and worldwide campaigns.</p>
<p>mediasmart&#8217;s office in London will be headed by Mel Likimani. Mel Likimani has more than 14 years digital advertising experience having worked in companies like Audiencielinx, as Managing Director, Adconion as Sales Director, and Buongiorno as Advertising Sales Manager.</p>
<p>Mel Likimani comments that “mediasmart is a company with huge potential in the European market and especially in the UK. As one of the early entrants into the Mobile RTB space our bidding process and optimisation algorithm has been fine tuned to the particular nuances found within mobile. With mobile now established as one of the fastest growing areas in the advertising industry, our mission is to deliver positive results to both performance and brand led campaigns coupled with best-in-market client services and data and analytics integration”.</p>
<p>Noelia Amoedo, mediasmart’s CEO explains, “I am delighted to welcome Mel to our management team. Given his skills and experience to date, he will be critical to helping us deliver on mediasmart’s international expansion plans, and I have no doubt he will position the company as a key player in the UK mobile advertising market”.</p>
<p>mediasmart is a technology start-up focused on optimising the media buying process in mobile (both on smartphones and tablets). Thanks to mediasmart, its proprietary DSP (Demand Side Platform) technology, mediasmart maximises advertising effectiveness for agencies and advertisers. mediasmart is a self-learning platform that optimises the media buying process on RTB by using predictive targeting, audience tagging and retargeting, impacting users more whenever the probabilities of generating engagement with a given campaign are higher. For advertisers, this translates into campaigns whose performance continuously improves with time.</p>
