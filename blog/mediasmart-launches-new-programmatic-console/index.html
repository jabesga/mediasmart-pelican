			<blockquote>
<p>The most intuitive and complete self-service interface, with industry-first integrated customer support</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mediasmart Mobile - a company that licenses its leading mobile DSP (Demand Side Platform), has unveiled its new console, empowering customers to access award winning programmatic technology through an easy to use interface that dramatically enhances the process of creating and managing campaigns.</p>
<p>As an enhancement to its traditional offering - one of the first to market in the mobile programmatic space - the new web application and API has been built from scratch and beta tested by mediasmart customers for the past eight months. It offers many new features, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>An enhanced user experience that is extremely fast to load and operate, allowing users to quickly navigate through the multiple options within an advertising campaign.</li>
<li>A wizard that guides customers through the basic steps required to set up their campaigns and a context-sensitive guide to explain the concepts within each area.</li>
<li>An industry first customer care section integrated into the app itself, allowing users to easily report any issues and interact directly with the mediasmart team for effective resolution.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>“With fast execution and management now crucial to a successful mobile campaign, mediasmart’s console has quickly become one of our most used technologies. As one of the most advanced tools in our arsenal, it allows us to rapidly manage and optimize our campaigns, through the most user-friendly interface out there.”</em> – Says Nicolas Saraiva, Head of Media Buying &amp; Operations @ Mozoo Group.</p>
<p>The interface is also fully customizable, allowing customers to adapt the look and feel to their brand, and is accessible through mobile devices (iOs 7+ and Android 5+), allowing customers to easily work outside of the office. It offers online and email notifications as well, to instantly inform customers of activity within campaigns requiring immediate action and to provide recommendations so that they can stay in constant control of their campaigns. Together with a range of sophisticated reporting and analysis tools, this helps mediasmart customers act faster on any issues affecting their campaigns and maximize results.</p>
<p><em>“Our ambition is to provide the best mobile first DSP in the marketplace. The new console is not only the best user interface for the platform, but also the best foundation to easily incorporate new features and guarantee speed of operation”</em>, says Javier Jiménez, Head of Product at mediasmart.</p>
<p><em>“Having the best user experience is absolutely critical to scale and cope with the exponential market growth we are seeing. Thanks to the work we´ve done with our beta customers in the past eight months, we are very confident that the upgrade will be well received”</em>.</p>
