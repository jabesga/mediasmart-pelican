    <p>tenthavenue &#8211; a WPP company &#8211; has selected mediasmart as the technology provider to help streamline its programmatic media buying operations.</p>
<p>mediasmart&#8216;s mobile-first demand side platform – will be used in a self-serve mode, empowering tenthavenue teams to programmatically buy media using the direct agreements tenthavenue holds with media owners, and within the open marketplace via Real Time Bidding.</p>
<p>The IAB (Internet Advertising Bureau) UK forecasted last August that by 2017, between 60% and 75% of all digital advertising will be traded programmatically. Comparing mobile versus desktop, mobile already drives a larger percentage of media investment through some form of programmatic technology today (RTB or Direct). Mobile inventory, particularly in-app, is also growing at a much faster pace.</p>
<p>The partnership with a mobile-first technology provider, will help to further position tenthavenue as a leading programmatic player and enable tenthavenue&#8217;s advertisers to engage with their audiences more effectively than ever.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are thrilled to partner with tenthavenue, a partner that not only understands the paradigm change that programmatic and the growth of mobile have meant for the digital advertising industry, but which plans to take advantage of it to deliver more value to advertisers&#8221;, Noelia Amoedo, CEO of mediasmart, said. &#8220;We bring our technology to this partnership in addition to our experience and mobile expertise&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;This partnership fits perfectly with our personalized content distribution strategy as it contributes directly to three tenthavenue pillars: data, technology and media. Our team thoroughly evaluated eight demand side platforms, and we are confident mediasmart is the best choice”, Ludovic Chayriguès, tenthavenue France COO, explains. “Our goal is to help our clients get the most out of their digital and out-of-home strategies, with a strong focus on mobile. This strategic partnership brings us one step closer in that direction&#8221;.</p>
