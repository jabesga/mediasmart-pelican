<h2>V. EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES</h2>
<p>Access to the WEBSITE and usage of the BSMART PLATFORM does not imply any kind of warranty, which MEDIASMART expressly refuses, regarding the quality, truthfulness, accuracy, lawfulness, current reality or validity, as well as the usefulness or adaptation to the purpose of usage of whoever accesses them. Both access to the BSMART PLATFORM and the use that may be made of the information and contents included therein or which is accessible therefrom is made under the USER’s exclusive responsibility.
Under no circumstances and to no extent shall MEDIASMART be liable for either direct or indirect damages, nor for consequential damage or loss of profit, for the resulting damages arising from use of the BSMART PLATFORM, nor for the information and contents of the WEBSITE or accessible from or through it. MEDIASMART offers USERS no warranty, express or implicit, and refuses any liability for the integrity, accuracy, availability, opportunity, security or reliability of the BSMART PLATFORM. MEDIASMART shall not be liable for any damage, loss of data or any other damage as regards the BSMART PLATFORM and/or the information contained or hosted therein.
In no way does MEDIASMART guarantee the quality, truthfulness, accuracy, lawfulness, current reality or validity, as well as the usefulness or adaptation to any purpose of the functionalities comprised in the BSMART PLATFORM. MEDIASMART also excludes, to the full extent provided by law, any liability of any kind for the quality, truthfulness, accuracy, lawfulness, current reality, validity or usefulness/adaptation to any purpose regarding the BSMART PLATFORM and/or the contents that make up the WEBSITE.
The WEBSITE and/or the BSMART PLATFORM may contain links to pages that, although within the WEBSITE, are under the responsibility of third parties. Furthermore, the WEBSITE may contain links to pages in all cases external thereto. In both cases, MEDIASMART cannot control or supervise such content in any way. MEDIASMART excludes, to the full extent provided by law, any liability of any kind, arising from the existence or possibility to access such contents.
Furthermore, MEDIASMART shall not be liable in any case, even indirectly or vicariously, for products or services provided or offered by other persons or entities, or for contents, information, communications, opinions or declarations of any kind originating from or given by third parties and which are accessible through the BSMART PLATFORM.
MEDIASMART reserves the right to unilaterally withdraw the license for use of the BSMART PLATFORM from any USER licensee that breaches any of the principles governing these terms and conditions.
MEDIASMART does not provide any warranty that the BSMART PLATFORM will meet the USER licensee’s requirements without interruption, securely or free of errors.
Security and Privacy: MEDIASMART shall reasonably use the means within its powers to provide security systems that reasonably protect its systems and the data contained therein against deliberate attacks, malicious software, etc.
Nevertheless, the USER understands and accepts the aspects involved in providing the services via Internet in view of the open, decentralized and global nature of this communications network.
For this reason, MEDIASMART does not guarantee the impregnability of its security systems nor the privacy of the information hosted therein. MEDIASMART excludes, to the full extent provided by law, any liability of any kind for shortcomings in security on the WEBSITE and/or the BSMART PLATFORM, in addition to the consequences that may arise from them.
Cookies Usage Notice: The BSMART PLATFORM uses “cookies” for the sole purpose of permitting and providing the USER’s interaction with it. Furthermore, the statistical services – ours or third parties’ -, used by the BSMART PLATFORM and/or WEBSITE use “cookies” for the sole purpose of establishing metrics and patterns of site usage. Access, use and, in general, navigation of the WEBSITE and/or the BSMART PLATFORM necessarily implies consent of the user to the use of “cookies” by MEDIASMART and/or its service providers.
USER consents in such cookie usage and will be able to consult every detail in relation to it in our “Cookie Usage Notice”.
Interruptions and/or Suspension of the System:
Both the BSMART PLATFORM and the WEBSITE shall be generably accessible without interruption on the Internet. However, USERS are notified that MEDIASMART does not guarantee in any way such continuity due to the nature of the medium through which the service is provided.
USERS understand and accept the aspects involved in providing services through Internet in view of the open, decentralized, global nature of the network.
Accordingly, by way of example, below are some of the situations that may temporarily interrupt the provision of services:
Maintenance work on servers and/or data lines
Damage to servers and/or data lines
Deliberate attacks against the system’s security and integrity
Computer viruses or the presence of malicious code in the pages that make up or are accessible from the WEBSITE and/or the BSMART PLATFORM
MEDIASMART excludes, to the full extent provided by law, any liability of any kind arising from the temporary interruption in availability of the BSMART PLATFORM and/or the WEBSITE on the Internet.
The USER is notified that MEDIASMART may at any time, at its sole discretion and without any obligation to give prior notice, definitively suspend the presence of the WEBSITE and/or the BSMART PLATFORM on Internet and therefore of the services provided from or through it, notwithstanding what may have been stipulated in this respect – as the case may be – under the relevant Particular Conditions. MEDIASMART is exempt from any kind of liability arising from the consequences that could be caused by the definitive suspension in providing such services.</p>
<h2>VI. VOLUNTARY UNSUBSCRIPTION, EXCLUSION AND RESPONSIBILITIES</h2>
<p>Any USER may request his or her subscription cancelation, at any time, as a USER of the WEBSITE. MEDIASMART shall have a term of 30 days to study such USER’S situation regarding all the services they were subscribed to in order to, as the case may be, issue an invoice for any usage that, upon receiving the request for subscription cancelation, was pending payment.</p>
<p>Should there exist no amount pending settlement and/or collection, the subscription cancelation shall be made effective immediately. Otherwise, the subscription cancelation shall be subordinate to the effective collection of such amounts by MEDIASMART.</p>
<p>The USER is responsible for proper use of the WEBSITE, of the BSMART PLATFORM and of the services contracted from or through it. Any contrary use of the services by the USER shall imply immediate exclusion from the WEBSITE and from the BSMART PLATFORM with loss of their condition as registered USER thereof, with no right to any compensation and without prejudice to the corresponding legal action that MEDIASMART may bring.
The falsehood of personal and/or professional data provided by the USER during the registration process in the WEBSITE, the BSMART PLATFORM or in any of the services provided from or through them may imply immediate exclusion from the WEBSITE and from the BSMART PLATFORM with loss of condition as registered USER thereof, with no right to any compensation and without prejudice to the corresponding legal action that MEDIASMART or third parties may bring.</p>
<p>Any type of action by USERS that could endanger or damage systems, equipment or services accessible directly or indirectly through the BSMART PLATFORM and/or WEBSITE, may imply their immediate exclusion therefrom, with loss of their condition as registered USER, with no right to any compensation and without prejudice to the relevant legal action that MEDIASMART may commence.</p>
<p>Any type of action by USERS that breaches these terms and conditions, the Particular Conditions that could regulate specific Services, the Law or generally accepted good practices, may imply their immediate exclusion from the WEBSITE and/or the BSMART PLATFORM with loss – as the case may be -, of their condition as registered USER thereof, with no right to any compensation and without prejudice to the corresponding legal action that MEDIASMART may commence.</p>
<p>USERS shall be solely responsible for any claim, in-court or out-of-court legal action, brought both by third parties against the USER and against MEDIASMART, based on usage of the BSMART PLATFORM and/or of the services contrary to law, morality, good faith and generally accepted good practices.</p>
<h2>VII. NOTICES</h2>
<p>For the purposes of notice servicing, MEDIASMART designates as its contact address the one set forth as its own under the heading of these terms and conditions.
The email provided by the USER during the registration process on the WEBSITE shall be the one used by MEDIASMART for the purpose of notice servicing to the USER.
The USER is required to properly update the data for serving notice referenced in this clause.</p>
<p>All notices that MEDIASMART serves to the USER shall be considered as validly made if they have been carried out using the data and in the manner described above. MEDIASMART accepts no liability for any damage that may be caused by USERS’ non-compliance with their obligation to keep their contact data updated.</p>
<h2>VIII. SEVERABILITY AND ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h2>
<p>Should any stipulation contained under these terms and conditions be declared null and void, this shall not affect the validity and effectiveness of the other clauses.
These terms and conditions of the services provided by MEDIASMART through the WEBSITE make up the entire agreement between the parties, considering them to be of a higher rank than any previous written or verbal agreement, understanding, statement, representation, negotiation or covenant regarding this matter.</p>
<h2>IX. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION</h2>
<p>These terms and conditions shall be governed and construed in every regard in accordance with the Laws of the Kingdom of Spain.</p>
<p>Both MEDIASMART and the USER undertake to endeavor to solve any disagreements that could arise in their commercial relationships in an amicable manner.
To settle any litigious matter that could arise in their commercial relationships, both parties agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the Courts and Tribunals of the city of Madrid (Spain), except -as the case may be-, mandatory legal submission to a party’s jurisdiction.</p>
